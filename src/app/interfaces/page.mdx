# Testing


> Testing Distributed Systems

The following are types of tests one can perform on a distributed system:

* **Functional Testing** is conducted to test whether a system performs as it was specified or in accordance with formal requirements
* **Performance Testing** tests the reliability and responsiveness of a system under different types of conditions and scenarios
* **Penetration Testing** tests the system for security vulnerabilities
* **End-to-End Testing** is used to determine whether a systemâ€™s process flow functions as expected
* **Fuzzing** is used to test how a system responds to unexpected, random, or invalid data or inputs


### Motivation

This design spec aims to specify and produce a versatile testing platform designed to automate the tests listed above, making it faster and simpler to conduct them on distributed systems where it was traditionally difficult to do so.

**End-to-End tests** can be designed by applying exit code checks for process completion, success, or failure in tasks and phases.

**Performance tests** can be conducted by analyzing data from tests that apply a variety of network conditions and combinations thereof.

**Functional tests** can use a combination of tasks, phases, supplemental services and sidecars, and network conditions, among other tools.


> These processes and tools are further described in this documentation.


### On Failures

- software.
- configuration failures.
- liveness failures.

> Question: should certain failures be traded-off in favor of a liveness failure?
