# **getValidators**

> List getValidators()

Get a list of validator registrations for validators scheduled to propose in the current and next epoch.

    * Used by builders to know when to submit bids for an upcoming proposal.  * Returns an array of validator registrations for the current and next epoch.  * Each entry includes a slot and the validator with assigned duty.  * Slots without a registered validator are omitted.

# **submitBlock**

> submitBlock(submitBlock_request, cancellations)

Submit a new block to the relay.

    * Blocks can be submitted as JSON or SSZ, and optionally GZIP encoded. To be   clear, there are four options: JSON, JSON+GZIP, SSZ, SSZ+GZIP. If JSON, the   content type should be &#x60;application/json&#x60;. If SSZ, the content type should   be &#x60;application/octet-stream&#x60;.  * The relay will simulate the block to verify properties and proposer   payment in the payment transaction from builder to proposer   &#x60;fee_recipient&#x60; at the end of block.  * For accountability, builder signature is over the SSZ encoded &#x60;message&#x60;.  * The &#x60;message&#x60;, which does not include the transactions, will be made   public via the data API, allowing anyone to verify the builder signature.  * Any new submission by a builder will overwrite a previous one by the same   &#x60;builder_pubkey&#x60;, even if it is less profitable.
