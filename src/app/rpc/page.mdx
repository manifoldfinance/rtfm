# RPC Methods

## `eth_simulateTransaction`

### Rationale
The request parameters are the same as eth_sendTransaction, and the response is a subset of a transaction receipt object you can obtain using eth_getTransactionReceipt, for consistency and familiarity.

Note that it does not require a signed transaction (raw tx), as the motivation is to provide more information to the user before signing happens.

### Implementation
There is an existing method eth_estimateGas that already performs transaction dry runs, but the method only returns the amount of gas used by the transaction. The code for eth_estimateGas may be reusable for the implementation of eth_simulateTransaction.


## `eth_getTransactionBySenderAndNonce`

## Cached RPC Responses

- eth_getBlockByHash
- eth_getBlockByNumber
- eth_getBlockTransactionCountByHash
- eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber
- eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex
- eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex
- eth_getTransactionByHash
- eth_getTransactionReceipt

Additionally, there's calls have a potential for being cached for a specific amount of time or assuming the future existence of an invalidation event (as e.g. the existence of a new transaction or block):

- eth_estimateGas
- eth_getStorageAt
