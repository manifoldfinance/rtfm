# Security

## Software Defects

At CommodityStream LLC, security is a priority. But regardless of how much effort we put into system security, there may still be vulnerabilities present. If you discover a vulnerability, we want to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our clients and our systems.

## Defect Response

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the our projects, we’d love to hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.
